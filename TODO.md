# TODO

## Next

- Architecture docs page (currently placeholder)
- Add more platforms: linux/arm64, darwin/amd64
- Test full workflow: clean install → bin:download → run
- Tag v0.1.2 with all fixes

---

Any code thats not our code can be WAY smarter in terms of decideding then it needs to rebuild  

---

Also, we can go further, Why cant we , from taskfile, poll for the third party repos changing ? the ci just has a cron to call the same taskfile.

Each taskfile can easiyl have this ans it will all line up into the manifest and sha etc ?
