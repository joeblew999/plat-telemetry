# TODO

We can round trip it by just adding a single github workflow that itslef runs task and then uploads releases, and so then a user with just the root task file can run it ALL. THis is because the Release is tagged with the binaries in the release and the taskfiles loaded off the source.   This is exactly what the xplat project is trying to formalise, which includes task and process compose.   https://github.com/joeblew999/xplat. But first i need to finish XPlat.
